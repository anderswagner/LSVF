# L(ocality) S(ensitive) V(oronoi) F(ilter)

A take on LSH, resulting in a "Voronoi"-like topology with filtering applied from FALCONN++.

## LSH Research

This repo contains data and queries from the SISAP 2023 indexing challenge https://sisap-challenges.github.io/.

Requires python 3.10 or later (for int.bit_count() function).

`LSVF.py` contains the implementation of the proposed algorithm.
